## Dataset Description
For this notebook, i want to use datasets from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/binaryjoker/airline-passenger-satisfaction). 

The dataset has a purpose to measuring customer satisfaction for modern businesses as it can significantly contribute to a continuing effort of service quality improvement. In order to meet customer expectations and achieve higher quality levels, airlines need to develop a specific mechanism of passenger satisfaction measurement.
